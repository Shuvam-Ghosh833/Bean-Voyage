<h2>Bean Voyage- A fully responsive CoffeeHouse website</h2>
<br>
<b>Technology Used:</b> HTML, CSS, Javascript
<br>
<h3>Challenges faced: </h3>
<ul>
   <li> Hiding the Navbar while scrolling down :  Fixed by checking "lastScrollPos < window.scrollY" and adding classes accordingly</li>
    <li>Making the unique sliding testimonial</li>
    <li>Smoothening the UI</li>
</ul>

<b>Live Demo 2:  https://beanvoyage.onrender.com</b>

Note: The Deployment Server used in Live Demo 2 is free version. So it might take longer to load and the long waiting has nothing to do with the code. I made it as efficient as i could
